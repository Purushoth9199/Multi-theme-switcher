    <h1>About Cartzilla</h1>
    <p>
      Cartzilla is the beast of bargainsâ€”built as a frontend playground to show off a multi-theme
      experience. It munches through themes (minimal, dark with sidebar, and playful card-grid),
      remembers your preference, and serves up products in layouts that actually look distinct.
      No heavy UI frameworks, just clean TypeScript, React, and thoughtful design.
